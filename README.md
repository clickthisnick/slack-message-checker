# Slack Stats
Slack gives you these stats about messaging:
https://honestbuildings.slack.com/stats

My goals are:
1.) Reduce the amount of slack message I send
2.) Increase the effectiveness of my messages

The rules are going to be:
1.) Ensure questions end with a question mark - To ensure people get I'm looking for a response
2.) Ensure all messages either have a link to somewhere or are relevant - No more lols

To do this I'm going to quickly create an html place to type messages.
Then clicking a button with validate my message as either to send or not send.

I'm starting this experiment with the last 7 days sending:
557 Messages*

* The 557 message count also includes me sending messages to slackbots which run commands
